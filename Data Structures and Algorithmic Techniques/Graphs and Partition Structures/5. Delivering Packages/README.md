# Delivering Packages

The region of Upper Dispersion is formed by a multitude of beautiful houses scattered across hillsides and hills. The houses are connected by highways, small roads, paths or trails, depending on the areas and the importance of their owners. The characteristics of these connections are very varied, from wide practically flat roads to steep trails sometimes muddy and very difficult to travel, especially uphill.

The office of the transport company that serves the region is located in one of these houses. Each day, a single delivery person must deliver the received packages and for this has a motorcycle whose cargo compartment is so small that it can only carry one package at a time. With these restrictions, the routine of the suffering delivery person consists of taking one of the packages, carrying it to the recipient's house, and returning to the office for the next package. Due to the conditions of the roads, there are occasions when it is interesting, or even inevitable, that the return path follows a different route than the outbound one.

Knowing the effort required for the delivery person to travel through the different roads in each passable direction, and the houses where packages must be delivered on a specific day, can you help him decide the best way (the one with the least total effort) to deliver the packages? The delivery person has complete freedom to choose in what order to deliver the packages and what routes to follow, both for going and returning.

**Input**

The input is composed of several test cases, each occupying several lines. The first line contains the number N (between 1 and 10,000) of houses in the region and the second the number C (between 1 and 100,000) of direct connections between houses. Next, C lines appear, each with three integers, origin destination effort, indicating that you can go directly from the origin house to the destination house (houses are numbered from 1 to N) with the corresponding effort (a value between 1 and 10,000). Note that if a connection is passable in both directions it will appear twice, with the origin and destination swapped and with possibly different effort for each direction (after all, going up is not the same as going down).

After the description of the region, a line appears with two integers: O is the number of the house where the office is located (the delivery person must start and end their work day at this house) and P (between 1 and N) is the number of packages to deliver; and another line with the P numbers of the houses where the recipients live.

**Output**

For each test case, the program must write a line with the minimum effort necessary to deliver all the packages for that day. It is guaranteed that this value will never be greater than 10^9. If for a day the delivery is impossible because there are not enough connections to build the necessary routes, the program will write "Impossible".
