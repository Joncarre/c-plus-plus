# Grafo bipartito

An undirected graph is bipartite if its vertices can be distributed in two disjoint sets in such a way that all edges have an end in each of those sets. In other words, a graph is bipartite if its vertices can be colored using two colors such that there is no edge connecting two vertices of the same color.

**Input**

The input is composed of several test cases. For each case, the first line contains the number of vertices of the graph, V (between 1 and 10,000), and the second the number of edges, A (between 0 and 100,000). Next appear A lines, each with two integers representing the ends of each of the edges (values between 0 and V 1). The graphs do not contain edges from one vertex to itself nor more than one edge connecting the same pair of vertices.

**Output**

For each test case the word YES will be written in a separate line if the graph is bipartite and NO otherwise.
